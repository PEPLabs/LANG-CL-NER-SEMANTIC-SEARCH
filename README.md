# NER Semantic Search Lab
This lab will have you write code to perform NER Semantic searches on a pre-built ChromaDB database to grab the most relevant documents from the vector database.

# Files to Modify
The code you should modify, as well as the instructions for completing the lab, are in main/lab.py. The main module contains a main section you may use to manually test your code. You should not modify tests/lab_test.py. You must pass all test cases provided in tests/lab_test.py to pass the lab.
